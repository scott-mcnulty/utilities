# Example Usage

This directory contains an example python app to demostrate a simple case to test if you're able to connect to the database.

Update the username, password, and database connection values in the [connection_config.py file](src/connection/connection_config.py) or set them as environment variables using the names in the file.

Test out your connection by using something similar to what is done in [app.py](src/app.py).
